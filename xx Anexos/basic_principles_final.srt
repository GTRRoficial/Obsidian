1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,570
What is today's video about?

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:06,000
today's video will be a summary
of the basic principles of communism,

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:06,510
that is,

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,260
If this is your
first contact with communism

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,110
maybe this video would be
a good way to start.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,040
And my goal here is to show
the common bases of communism.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,480
And why do I say
'common bases'?

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,590
Because there are
different lines of thought on communism.

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,720
But I'll present

10
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,020
the common bases
of all these lines.

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,900
Except for some
weird sects here and there.

12
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,180
Here we will see
the very basic of the basics.

13
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,700
At the end of this video,

14
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,890
I'll show a reading guide,

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,640
Sharing all the books for free
except for one,

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,920
we'll talk about
that one later,

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,420
and suggest
a reading order, alright?

18
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,740
I strongly recommend
that you read,

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,850
and don't only use
this video as a reference.

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,850
It's really worth it
to read and reread

21
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,440
even if you already
master the topic

22
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,590
for it to sink
into your head.

23
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,000
It's also worth it to search
for additional bibliography

24
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,840
because what
I will show here

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,880
is quite basic, okay?

26
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,640
Quite, quite basic.

27
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,180
So, let's go:

28
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,800
basic principles of communism.

29
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,470
Firstly, I want to thank
Groselha Atômica.

30
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,520
@panquetriste who made
this wonderful art that's here in the screen.

31
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,140
I'd want to thank
Thales Caramante and João Carvalho, too,

32
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,060
who helped me
with the script of this video.

33
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,560
And I beg of you,

34
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,090
Marxologist
who has a PhD in Marxism,

35
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,320
Please, understand
that I'm talking in a basic,

36
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,450
simplified way, right?

37
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,300
You don't need
to quote the Grundrisse,

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,250
Or the letters
Marx sent whoever,

39
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,170
just don't, OK?

40
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,050
We know you know
a lot about Marx.

41
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,850
And fine,
we talk about that another day, right?

42
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,150
So, let's go:
What's communism?

43
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,960
Anti-clickbait,
the definition in the screen:

44
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,900
The communism is the doctrine of the conditions
of the liberation of the proletariat.

45
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,100
This is a quote from Engels,

46
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,280
From the book called
“The Principles of Communism”.

47
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,680
So, first of all,
don't be scared of the word 'doctrine'.

48
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,060
Doctrine means
a set of principles.

49
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,980
It isn't like indoctrination,
doesn't conflate 'doctrine' with 'dogma'.

50
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,980
Today there is
a lot of talk about indoctrination,

51
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,610
and people think
this is permanently negative, right?

52
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,910
So, communism is the doctrine of the conditions
for the liberation of the proletariat.

53
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,800
In case someone doesn't know,
what's proletariat?

54
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,650
Proletarians are those
who live from the sale of their labor power,

55
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,880
and who work in exchange for a wage.
This is the proletariat.

56
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,830
Moreover,
what is the goal of communism?

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,280
Communism aims for a society
without social classes, that is,

58
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,010
a society without exploitation
of human beings by other human beings.

59
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,920
And a society without classes
can only exist through

60
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,740
a society without private ownership
of the means of production.

61
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,340
And, ultimately,
without State.

62
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,870
It is a society free of exploitation

63
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,230
without social classes,

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,660
without private property
of means of production

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,370
and without state.

66
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,990
That's it.
This is communism.

67
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,380
Has communism
ever happened in history?

68
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,310
No, the Soviet Union
was not a communist country,

69
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,880
Cuba is not
a communist country,

70
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,390
and China is not
a communist country.

71
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,990
Are there classes?
It isn't communism.

72
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,560
Is there State?
It isn't communism.

73
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,190
So communism is
where we want to reach.

74
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,170
We'll talk about
what the Soviet Union, Cuba, China, etc are

75
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:52,800
or were.

76
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,300
So, let's go.

77
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,450
Who outlined
this set of principles for the first time?

78
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,280
Who described it?

79
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,180
Who theorized
this set of principles?

80
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,260
And now
we have to talk about him, right?

81
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,350
Karl Marx.

82
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,710
Marx is the most important theoretician
of all the set of communist principles.

83
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,650
Marx is
absolutely unavoidable.

84
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,530
It is impossible to be
a communist without reading Marx.

85
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,270
Impossible.

86
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:15,920
First of all:

87
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,180
Are Marxism and communism
the same thing?

88
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,540
No, Marxism and communism
are not the same thing,

89
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,440
but they are deeply connected.

90
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,640
The difference between
Marxism and communism

91
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,210
will be a bit clearer
as our presentation goes,

92
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,800
but remember that
they are not exactly synonyms, okay?

93
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,560
And what Marxism consists of?

94
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,760
What is Marxism?

95
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,160
Marxism contains
three constitutive parts:

96
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:35,800
three.

97
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,620
philosophical one,
an economic one and a political one.

98
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,070
The philosophical part consists of
dialectical and historical materialism,

99
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,260
the economic part,
of the critique of political economy,

100
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,310
and the political part,
of scientific socialism.

101
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,040
These parts are
not isolated from each other, right?

102
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,420
They are not isolated.
They are intertwined

103
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,360
they interact.

104
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,460
In these three parts

105
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,750
reside the common bases
of any communist.

106
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,950
My goal here is not to tell

107
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,920
the life stories of Marx,
Engels and Lenin, right?

108
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,760
I'll tell just a little of Marx's story

109
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,640
to be a bit clearer about
what I'm wanting to say.

110
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,000
So, in 1818,

111
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,000
Marx was born in a town called Trier,

112
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,080
which was formerly in Prussia,
where today is Germany.

113
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,420
In the 1840's,

114
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,880
he started writing for
a Prussian newspaper

115
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,050
and he was banned from Prussia

116
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,400
because he was
very critical of monarchist politics.

117
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,990
Of Prussian monarchist politics.

118
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,600
In 1844,
he goes to France as an exile,

119
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,920
and he meets a guy called
Friedrich Engels.

120
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,340
The guy with the largest mustache
I've ever seen.

121
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,120
Engels was a son
of an industrial bourgeois

122
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,720
and would become
Marx's friend, intellectual partner,

123
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,820
and patron.

124
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,740
And for those who don't know,
patron is someone who funds some project.

125
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,170
So, yes, Engels was
a bourgeois's son,

126
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,030
but Marx wasn't.

127
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,260
Marx studied Philosophy
at the University of Berlin

128
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,930
and there
he took part in a group

129
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,680
called Young Hegelians.

130
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,110
Here there is an illustration
of the Young Hegelians.

131
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,010
As the name says,

132
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,520
while Marx studied philosophy
in University of Berlin,

133
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,660
he was very influenced by
the ruling philosophy in Germany at that time

134
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,820
which was Hegel's philosophy.

135
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,250
And there,
in the 1840s,

136
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,160
Marx and Engels
start to elaborate

137
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,950
a critique of the Young Hegelians.

138
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,450
They start to differ from
the Young Hegelians

139
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,750
and from Hegel himself.

140
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,110
This critique
that Marx and Engels do

141
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,030
of Hegel
and the Young Hegelians

142
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,870
would comprise
the philosophical pillar of Marxism.

143
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,380
And right there
I want to add a thing, right?

144
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,360
Excuse myself.

145
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,180
Maybe, in this video,

146
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,670
maybe I'll start
with the hardest part.

147
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,930
There are some who say
that the philosophical pillar of Marxism

148
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,850
is the hardest one.

149
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,450
But why did I choose to start talking about it first

150
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,260
if it is the hardest?

151
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,810
Because Marx
formulated the other pillars

152
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,470
of the philosophy.

153
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,310
The philosophical pillar
was the first to be formulated.

154
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,550
And this pillar give us
the Marxist method.

155
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,500
So, if you are having
a hard time understanding it,

156
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,620
know that isn't
uncommon at all.

157
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,160
It is something
that is quite usual.

158
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,750
I took too long to understand
this philosophical pillar.

159
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,100
It demanded
a lot of reading.

160
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,960
What I ask is
that you give yourself a chance to try

161
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,050
To at least get familiar
with this vocabulary.

162
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,910
In the end, as I said,

163
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,180
I'll provide you
with some extra reading

164
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,180
to try to improve
this process a little.

165
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,760
So, let's go.

166
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,450
Returning to the beginning
of our explanation.

167
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,690
You know that communism is

168
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,950
the set of principles
for the working class liberation.

169
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,620
In other words,
to be clearer:

170
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,610
The final goal

171
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,850
is the end of classes,

172
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,770
the private ownership
of the means of production

173
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,400
and the State.

174
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,850
And it must already be popping up

175
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,260
in the minds of some people
who are hearing

176
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,700
this for the first time:

177
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,590
But isn't that utopian?

178
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,650
Is this not idealism?

179
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,260
Have you ever heard
that communism is utopian?

180
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,300
What is a utopia?

181
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,720
Are communists idealists?

182
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,300
Well,

183
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,670
little do people that never
got into contact with communism know

184
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,020
but communism appears
as a critique of utopianism

185
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,720
and a critique of idealism.

186
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,620
Marxism's philosophical pillar

187
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,720
is constituted
as a critique of utopianisms and idealisms

188
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,080
And that's what
we're going to talk about now.

189
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,160
We'll talk about
dialectical and historical materialism

190
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,930
and the name already sounds scary, right?
This a philosophical mouthful,

191
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,880
and that's why I said that I might have chosen
to start with the most complicated part,

192
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,140
but I beg you to give it a chance.

193
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,520
Alright then.

194
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,360
Remember Marx
was a Young Hegelian?

195
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,670
Well, even though
he was a harsh critic of Hegel's philosophy,

196
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,360
Marx was
heavily influenced by Hegel.

197
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,470
But influenced in what way?

198
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,020
Mainly regarding
a thing called dialectics.

199
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,920
So, dialectical
and historical materialism,

200
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,500
we'll begin
by talking a bit about dialectics.

201
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,600
So, what is dialectics?

202
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,860
That's something
we'd need ten volumes to answer,

203
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,120
but I'll try and summarize.

204
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,370
First of all,
Hegelian dialectics

205
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,080
was opposed to another
philosophical method called metaphysics,

206
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,720
which was the dominant
philosophical method up to Hegel.

207
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,520
In order for us to understand dialectics

208
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,400
it's worth it to understand
what metaphysics is

209
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,520
because one thing
makes the other clearer.

210
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,890
That's the part of the stream
where I'll cite the most, OK?

211
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,690
I'll avoid reading
too many quotations

212
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,940
but I think these ones are helpful

213
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,940
because this part is
quite difficult.

214
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:41,410
Right then,

215
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,900
we’ve said that dialectics
opposes metaphysics.

216
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,480
Engels:
"To the metaphysician,

217
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,130
things and their mental reflexes,

218
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,990
ideas, are isolated, are to be considered
one after the other and apart from each other,

219
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:58,590
are objects of investigation fixed, rigid,

220
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,950
given once for all.

221
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,520
He thinks in absolutely
irreconcilable antitheses

222
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,580
His communication is

223
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,890
'yea, yea; nay, nay'; for whatsoever
is more than these cometh of evil

224
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,840
For him, a thing either
exists or does not exist;

225
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,440
a thing cannot at the same time
be itself and something else.

226
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,190
Positive and negative
absolutely exclude one another".

227
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,160
That's metaphysics then.

228
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,120
In summary:

229
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:29,730
metaphysics is a method
that works with isolated,

230
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,040
fixed categories.

231
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,550
Dialectics, on the other hand,
another quote from Engels:

232
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,550
"...comprehends things
and their representations,

233
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,360
ideas,
in their essential connection,

234
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,090
concatenation,

235
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,870
motion,

236
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,930
origin
and ending.

237
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,360
Such processes as those mentioned above are,
therefore, so many corroborations

238
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,410
of its own
method of procedure".

239
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,270
That's referring to
passages from the book I'm quoting

240
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,740
"Socialism: Utopian and Scientific"
by Engels.

241
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,710
Dialectics is the philosophy

242
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,130
that works
with constantly moving categories

243
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,490
that relate to each other

244
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,890
by means
of contradictions, or contraries.

245
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,380
So, a famous example
Hegel gives is

246
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,690
the master-slave dialectics.

247
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,380
In summary, the master can exist
only if there is a slave.

248
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,520
Master and slave

249
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,090
aren't fixed, isolated,
unchanging categories.

250
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,480
The category of master

251
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,050
only exists through
the existence of the slave category.

252
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,990
Within the contradictions
between master and slave.

253
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,680
These categories
change throughout history

254
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,230
but I won't get too much into
the master-slave dialectics.

255
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,200
I'm just showing you
how the categories that dialectics works upon

256
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,780
are interconnected
and ever-changing.

257
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,250
That's it then.

258
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,570
So, according to Engels,
and I think that's a good analogy:

259
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,270
Metaphysics cannot see the woods
for it is worried about the trees.

260
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,310
For him and for Marx,

261
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,680
dialectics was
much more adequate

262
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,400
for understanding
not only natural sciences' phenomena,

263
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,860
but also society's.

264
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,210
An example of dialectics
Engels gives in this book I quoted

265
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,740
is Darwin's
theory of evolution.

266
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,500
Darwin's theory of evolution
was a huge blow to metaphysics

267
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,380
because it works
with transformation,

268
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,260
with historical change
in the very long term.

269
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,510
It made it impossible
to work with fixed categories,

270
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,200
categories
are now changing.

271
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,870
They transform,

272
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,010
they emerge and come to pass
as History goes on.

273
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,070
That's the dialectical principle
of Marx's philosophy,

274
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,270
which is influenced by Hegel.

275
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,010
Let's go to the other part then,
it was dialectical and historical materialism

276
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,200
Let's talk materialism.
Materialism.

277
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,440
I want you to do
a mental exercise now.

278
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,310
Look around you,
wherever you are.

279
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,500
Look around.
Look at everything that surrounds you.

280
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,690
Look if there's
a table nearby, a computer,

281
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,460
a cellphone,
a chair,

282
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,990
anything.

283
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,250
I want you to think about this:

284
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,470
who made these things?
Who manufactured them?

285
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,630
If there's a chair where you are,
who manufactured it?

286
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,250
If there's a couch,
who made that couch?

287
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,170
And further,
who transported it there?

288
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,530
If the couch has metal parts,

289
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,760
who mined the metals?

290
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,520
Whose hands extracted them
from the veins of the earth?

291
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,880
Now I want you to reflect

292
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,510
on how little we think about that.

293
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,850
How little we think

294
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,860
about who made
the objects that surround us.

295
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,700
And no, guys,
it wasn't machined,

296
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,710
it wasn't just machines.

297
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,940
We are surrounded by
an immense amount of human labor.

298
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,260
But we don't realize it.

299
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,260
We're disconnected
from the human labor that surrounds us.

300
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:28,072
Materialism is the understanding

301
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,608
that material production is
the basis for our social structure.

302
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,400
Not only do we have to think about
who made what is around us

303
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,980
but what surrounds us is

304
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,130
the basis upon
which we organize society.

305
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,880
The two things are connected.

306
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,520
That's materialism's
great trump card.

307
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,080
Let's go back to Hegel for a bit.

308
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,750
Marx incorporated
Hegel's dialectics.

309
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,220
But materialism arises
from a critique of Hegel.

310
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,910
A critique of what exactly?
Hegel was an idealist.

311
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,150
Remember I said Marxism
came around as a critique of idealism?

312
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,390
And this critique of idealism
is mainly a critique of Hegel's philosophy.

313
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,490
So, Marx takes Hegelian dialectics
but leaves out idealism.

314
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,200
Let's use a quotation
from Marx himself then:

315
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:17,000
“My dialectic method is
not only different from the Hegelian,

316
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,200
but is its direct opposite.

317
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,580
To Hegel, the life-process of the human brain,
i.e., the process of thinking,

318
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,970
which, under the name of ‘the Idea,’
(with a capital “I”)

319
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,970
he even transforms
into an independent subject,

320
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,770
is the demiurges
(for those who don't know, demiurges means deity)

321
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,730
and the real world is only the external,
phenomenal form of ‘the Idea.’

322
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,800
With me, on the contrary, the ideal is
nothing else than the material world

323
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,290
reflected by the human mind,
and translated into forms of thought".

324
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,450
That's a quotation from Capital.

325
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,730
Don't worry,
I know it's complicated but I'll explain.

326
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,860
For Hegel, the reality is
a manifestation of human ideas,

327
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,080
a manifestation of
human thought.

328
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,080
And human thought in its turn

329
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,190
is the manifestation of the original Idea
(With a capital “I”)

330
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,250
that comes
from the deity, from God.

331
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,910
Hegel's philosophy
has a theological outlook.

332
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,620
And the Young Hegelians
were also idealists.

333
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,800
They believed that
what prevented society's development

334
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,510
were the ideas
in people's minds.

335
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,400
There needed to be
a revolution in people's thought

336
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,890
and only then
from reason and thought

337
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,350
we would transform reality.

338
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,460
More than that,

339
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,330
as capitalism developed

340
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,330
there appeared philosophers
that saw what was happening,

341
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,590
the rise of poverty,
misery,

342
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,660
and devised fairer,
more egalitarian societies

343
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,280
that would free all of humanity.

344
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,230
Where?

345
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,310
In their minds.

346
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,220
According to Engels,
the more detailed these societies were,

347
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,370
the further they drifted from reality.

348
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,560
These philosophers became known
as Utopian socialists.

349
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,700
For those who don't know,
utopia is a 'non-place'

350
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,270
Idealism means
you create an idea in your head

351
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,190
and try to apply it to reality.

352
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,910
Materialism
is the opposite of that.

353
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,830
Marx puts this idea
upside-down.

354
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,840
It's not reality
that is created by our thoughts.

355
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,320
But rather our ideas are
an abstraction of reality.

356
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,520
First, we get into
contact with reality

357
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,100
and then we formulate ideas,
not the contrary.

358
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,320
And there is
an inseparable connection

359
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,280
inseparable

360
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,150
between material reality,

361
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,340
the objects that are around us,

362
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,340
and how
we organize society.

363
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,330
These two things
are inseparable.

364
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,690
There's no social organization
without a material backing,

365
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,150
a material substrate.

366
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,920
There's no use
in designing a society in our heads

367
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,110
and trying
to apply it to reality

368
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,430
while ignoring reality itself.

369
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,020
That's materialism.
That's the difference, right?

370
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,610
So, what is material reality?
To make it clearer,

371
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,310
it's not only nature,

372
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,010
but also the way we produce

373
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,500
Remember
I told you to look around?

374
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:45,100
That is all produced in order to
satisfy our material needs.

375
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,020
We have to sit down;
we make a chair.

376
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,200
That's part of
material reality as well.

377
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,060
But not only that,

378
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,970
our production also satisfies

379
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,110
our cultural
and intellectual cravings.

380
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,400
Not only eating,
clothing, housing

381
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,440
but also what we desire
to consume as culture.

382
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,660
This quote is
by Marx and Engels:

383
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,770
"What they [the individuals] are,
therefore, coincides with their production,

384
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,470
both with what they produce
and with how they produce.

385
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,880
The nature of individuals thus
depends on the material conditions

386
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,600
determining their production."

387
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,840
What we are depends
on how we produce our existence.

388
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,770
What we are depends on
how we eat,

389
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,520
where we live,
what we wear,

390
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,080
on how we wear.
It depends on that,

391
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,300
on how we transport ourselves,
how we satisfy our needs.

392
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,040
So, the way
we produce reality,

393
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,310
we call it
infrastructure.

394
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,980
Our infrastructure is the production
of food, of clothing, of houses, etc.

395
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,890
A social structure arises
over this infrastructure.

396
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,890
We call that
superstructure.

397
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,630
It's what is above the infrastructure.

398
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,290
What is there in the superstructure?
Culture, religion, morals, among other things.

399
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,960
That is, our culture,

400
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,200
our religion,

401
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,030
our morals,

402
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,560
are all above.

403
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:56,700
They are built upon a material basis.

404
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,140
That is to say,

405
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,670
for example,
that our religion has everything to do

406
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,700
with how we produce
our material reality,

407
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,550
how we produce our food,

408
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,200
our houses,
our clothes.

409
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,700
That is all connected

410
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,440
And we can never lose sight of
the material basis of reality.

411
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,910
One thing depends on the other.

412
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,140
Is this
a mechanical process, though?

413
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,190
Does that mean that every time
we produce food in the same way

414
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,480
the same religion will emerge?

415
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,140
No,

416
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:28,410
it doesn't mean that the same material basis
will give rise to the same superstructure,

417
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,290
but that the superstructure
is dependent on the material basis.

418
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,650
Dependent.

419
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,310
It is not mechanically
determined by it,

420
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,660
but dependent on it.

421
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,950
This is really important;

422
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,330
once this superstructure has risen,

423
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,620
it impacts back
on the material basis.

424
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,680
So, our culture,
our religion, our morals

425
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,410
can impact
on how we produce our reality.

426
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,060
But it doesn't exist
without that reality.

427
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,450
That's a dialectical movement.

428
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,090
Remember we said
dialectics was important?

429
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,970
In its connections,
in its movement,

430
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,160
and not in fixed categories.

431
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,140
Infrastructure and superstructure
aren't fixed, unchanging categories.

432
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,630
They are connected,
they interact with each other and they move.

433
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,730
I know it's complicated,

434
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,810
but give it a chance

435
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,040
and at least
get familiarized with this vocabulary:

436
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:14,000
materialism, material basis, infrastructure,
superstructure, dialectics, etc.

437
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,900
Remember it was
dialectical and historical materialism?

438
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,210
Where does
the historical part come in?

439
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,050
This method is such that
Marx and Engels perceive History

440
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:23,960
through the ways people produced
their reality in order to satisfy their needs

441
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,520
and how that affected
the social structure.

442
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,090
So, for Marx and Engels

443
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,990
the first historical fact is
the satisfaction of our needs.

444
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,670
The first time
a human built a tool

445
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,970
in order to satisfy a need.
That's the first historical fact.

446
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,350
From the moment we satisfy
a need on, we create other needs.

447
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,190
This is the historical process
of creating new needs.

448
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,690
The wheel of History
keeps on turning

449
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,080
as we satisfy our needs.

450
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,660
Marx and Engels
look at History

451
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,060
and ask:
how did they produce?

452
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,980
From this production,
what was the social structure?

453
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,370
How does the social structure
of said society

454
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,780
relate to the way
this society produces?

455
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,110
That's historical materialism.

456
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,580
For summarizing,
there's a quotation that's a bit long,

457
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,190
but it ties together
everything I've said.

458
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,270
"The materialist conception of history starts
from the proposition that the production.

459
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:15,210
of the means to support human life and, next
to production, the exchange of things produced,

460
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,230
is the basis of all social structure;
that in every society

461
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,440
that has appeared in history,
the manner in which wealth is distributed and

462
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,570
society divided into classes or orders

463
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,310
is dependent upon
what is produced, how it is produced,

464
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,710
and how the products
are exchanged.

465
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,370
From this point of view,

466
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,550
the final causes of
all social changes

467
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,300
and political revolutions

468
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,630
are to be sought,
not in men's brains,

469
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:46,030
not in men's better insights
into eternal truth and justice,

470
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,980
but in changes in the modes
of production and exchange.

471
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:56,580
They are to be sought, not in the philosophy,
but in the economics of each particular epoch."

472
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,160
This means that revolutions,
including the bourgeois revolutions,

473
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,500
didn't happen in the way
liberals themselves describe them.

474
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:07,070
The liberals say people started
demanding more freedom

475
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,710
and that propelled
the revolution forward.

476
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,260
No. Revolutions happen

477
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,400
when our way of producing
and reproducing life changes.

478
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,840
Every revolution has
a material basis, a material substrate.

479
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:24,630
It doesn't appear in someone's mind and is then
applied to reality because that's impossible,

480
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,850
that goes against
the laws of nature.

481
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,110
And that's what we call idealism.

482
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:35,670
Marxism emerges as an opposition,
as a critique of idealism and utopianism.

483
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,500
OK? Pay attention to
this last Engel's quote here:

484
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:43,110
"They are to be sought,
not in the philosophy, but in the economics.”

485
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,510
That's what we are going to talk about now:
the Critique of Economy.

486
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,510
So, one thing that I need you
to pay attention to is this:

487
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,510
Why did I first explain through
the philosophical pillar?

488
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,580
The philosophical pillar
gives us the method.

489
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,340
And Marx and Engels analyze everything
from now using this method.

490
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,060
Dialectical and historical materialism
is always the perspective.

491
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,520
This method is applied to reality
to understand reality.

492
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,750
And now we move on to
the economic pillar of Marxism.

493
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,160
Let's do it!

494
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,060
Remember I said that Marx
was exiled to France and he met Engels there?

495
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,920
So, Engels read Marx's texts
and he criticized Marx's texts

496
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,650
He said: “Marx, there is an economic dimension
missing from your analyses”

497
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,240
Then Marx closed himself
inside a library

498
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,650
and read the writings
of English economists,

499
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,320
especially these two on the screen:

500
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,680
Adam Smith and David Ricardo.

501
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,400
And I need to clarify now:

502
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,320
Can you see that I'm using the term
"Political Economy"

503
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,880
Back then,
"Political Economy" term was dominant

504
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:39,350
because it was clear that
"Economics" and "Politics" were inseparable.

505
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,880
As the bourgeois economy
was becoming dominant,

506
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,400
they discard the "political" part to give
Economics an alleged neutrality.

507
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,610
“No, no. Economics
has nothing to do with Politics.

508
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,890
Economics is Economics.

509
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,170
It is an exact science,

510
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,530
we conduct a study of reality neutrally."

511
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,070
And for Marxists,

512
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,880
until this day the expression used is
"Political Economy", OK?

513
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:02,690
Marxists don't disassociate
the economy from politics. Ever.

514
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,870
By the way,
I even put here, look.

515
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,740
For those who don't know,
Marx's masterpiece “Capital”,

516
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,600
“Das Kapital”

517
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,800
it says here:
“A Critique of Political Economy”,

518
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,030
“Capital: Critique of Political Economy",
it's the subtitle.

519
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,690
So, the Marxist economy develops out

520
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,450
of a critique of the political economy
of bourgeois economists.

521
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,040
And some would say,
just to make it clear for you,

522
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,530
some would say
there is no Marxist Economics,

523
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,160
that Marxist Economics is
the bourgeois economy's critique,

524
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,230
but you'll see controversy about it .

525
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,740
Just to let you know
that this exists.

526
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,290
What is the critique of
Marx's Political Economy?

527
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,290
It's an analysis of capitalism,
basically.

528
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,410
Marx lived at a time
when capitalism was already dominant.

529
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,890
But what is capitalism, folks?
What is capitalism?

530
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,990
And I'm telling you,

531
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,990
this Critique of
Political Economy's excerpt

532
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,610
will be where
I'll inject you with

533
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,710
mandatory vocabulary to understand
Critique of Political Economy, OK?

534
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,800
Here we are going to make
a kind of glossary because it's needed, right?

535
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,900
To truly understand; to know how to describe
what these terms mean.

536
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,720
I'm going to talk like that,
with just the cam, and we'll recap later.

537
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,590
Anyway, relax.

538
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,440
What is capitalism?

539
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,480
Capitalism is a mode of production, mode of production.

540
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,930
What is a "mode of production"?

541
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:21,490
It's the result of interactions between
productive forces and relations of production.

542
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,100
What are productive forces
and relations of production?

543
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:28,760
Productive forces are
how humans act on nature.

544
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:33,830
Relations of production are
how humans act on each other.

545
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,670
Therefore, we actuate
on nature and each other

546
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,520
The interaction between these actions
results in the mode of production, right?

547
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,610
Point number one:
What are the capitalist productive forces?

548
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,180
Capitalist productive forces are

549
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:57,280
the employment of industry, machinery,
automation of energy matrices

550
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:04,490
and especially division of labor.

551
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,430
In Capitalism,
our work is segmented,

552
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,930
it is broken down into
small specialized parts.

553
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,860
Therefore, our capitalist productive force
isn't just a machine,

554
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,680
but it's how we divide up this work.

555
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,840
What are the relations of production?

556
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,950
We talked about productive forces,
now we have relations of production.

557
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,890
Capitalist relations of production

558
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:32,750
are based on the exploitation of proletarian
labor by the bourgeoisie, OK?

559
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:38,690
The foundation
of the relations of production is exploitation.

560
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,010
We are going to
explain about exploitation further ahead.

561
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,010
First of all,

562
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,950
that exploitation is based
on a class division.

563
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,730
What is class?

564
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:55,190
Class, folks,
is a social division of labor.

565
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,800
Are there classless societies?
Yes.

566
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,190
In classless societies
everyone has to work,

567
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,680
everyone benefits
from the fruits of labor,

568
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,140
and the labor is divided
by ability or skill.

569
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,640
This type of division
we call "Natural Division".

570
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,270
In class societies,

571
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,260
there is no natural division,
there is a social division.

572
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,110
And what does it means?

573
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,660
Imagine that
you work in a factory.

574
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,260
The factory owner isn't
less skilled than you to work in the factory.

575
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,890
So, why do you work at the factory
and he doesn't?

576
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,930
Since he has
the same skills as you.

577
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,850
Because he belongs
to another class.

578
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,130
What determines the class is which position
you occupy in the production chain.

579
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,910
And under capitalism,
these classes are increasingly comprised

580
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,700
of the bourgeois, In other words, the class that
doesn't work and owns the means of production,

581
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,540
and proletariat, the class
that does work and owns nothing

582
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,920
other than their work force.

583
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,880
What divides these classes is
not skill, nor ability, not even vocation,

584
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,810
it is a social division.

585
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,350
Well then, another characteristic
of relations of production.

586
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,470
We have classes

587
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,130
and one of them owns
the means of production,

588
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:03,080
that is, these means of production are
private property of someone.

589
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,930
One of the central characteristics
of capitalism is the private property.

590
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,730
What is private property?

591
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,690
There is a classical definition
From the bourgeois economists themselves:

592
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:16,790
Private property is
the free disposal of another's labor power

593
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,540
When we are talking about
private property,

594
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,610
we are talking about private property
of the means of production.

595
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,130
Why did private property,
and only "private property",

596
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,840
become synonymous with private property
of the means of production?

597
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,060
Because the private property
of the means of production was

598
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,230
the first form of private property.

599
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,540
So, in the time of
Marx, Smith, and Ricardo,

600
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,770
talking about private property meant
private property of the means of production.

601
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,650
Back to definition:

602
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,950
Private property is the free disposal
of another one's labor power.

603
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,500
An example:

604
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,875
remember that mode of production

605
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,630
is the interaction between
productive force and relations of production?

606
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,010
Did we have other modes of production?
Yes.

607
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,270
We had, for example,
the feudal mode of production.

608
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:57,240
We had, for example,
the slave-owning mode of production.

609
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,080
For example,
in the slave-owning mode of production.

610
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,350
What is private property
in the slave-owning mode of production?

611
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:01,880
The slave.

612
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,150
Remember that private property is
the free disposal of another one's labor power?

613
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,570
How does the slave owner dispose
of the labor force of others?

614
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,630
By owning the person

615
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,560
Another person's work is
freely available to the slaveholder.

616
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,570
The person is
the owner's private property.

617
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,890
How this works in capitalism?

618
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,570
People are not the property
of the capitalist,

619
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,150
but the capitalist owns
the means of production.

620
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,570
Means of production, that is,
what is necessary for executing labor

621
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,570
is taken from the hand of workers,

622
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:33,290
and the capitalists controls the worker's
productive forces through wage labor.

623
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,630
Workers are forced to sell
their labor power

624
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,480
to work on the means of production
that have been taken from their hands.

625
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,680
And how this capitalist can take

626
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,460
these means of production
out of the worker's hand?

627
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:48,010
Because he owns
something called "Capital".

628
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,270
What is capital?

629
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,810
Capital can be summed up
in a simple few sentences

630
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,610
"Capital is value that creates value";

631
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,250
"resources that create resources";
"Wealth that creates wealth"

632
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,140
Capital is money?
No.

633
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,500
But capital can be money?
Yes.

634
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,070
They aren't synonymous,
it's that what I mean.

635
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,640
What you have
in your wallet now isn't capital, OK?

636
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,670
Capital is a resource
that can be in form of money

637
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,450
that is used
in the acquisition of means of production.

638
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,180
Factory, machine, land,
energy, raw material

639
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,770
and workforce.

640
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,500
Once such means are acquired

641
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,820
they become part of the capital.

642
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:25,840
So, factory, machine, energy,
and raw material are part of the capital, OK?

643
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,230
That's why capital
isn't just money.

644
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,170
Therefore, in short,

645
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,660
capitalist relations
of production are based

646
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,650
on class division. One class
owns the means of production and doesn't work,

647
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:37,600
and the other only owns
its own labor power and has to sell it.

648
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,910
This brings us to the last characteristic
of relations of production:

649
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,520
the Commodification
of Social Relations.

650
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:49,440
In capitalism, the commodity
is the center of social relations.

651
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,480
In capitalism,
we don't produce our existence,

652
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,920
we buy our existence.

653
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,680
You don't produce your food,
you buy your food.

654
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,020
You don't sew your clothes,
you buy your clothes.

655
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,470
You don't build your house,
you buy your house.

656
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,470
And you sell
your labor force too,

657
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,950
your labor force
becomes a commodity.

658
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,520
But what is a commodity?

659
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,880
A Commodity is something that is produced
for someone else's consumption,

660
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,350
and to be traded on the market.

661
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,740
This commodity element
deserves more attention.

662
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,720
Because, again,

663
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,090
as a commodity is the center
of all social relations in capitalism,

664
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,290
it needs to be understood.

665
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,290
Before that,
let's review everything.

666
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:24,970
Vocabulary:

667
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,920
Mode of Production: interaction between
productive forces and relations of production.

668
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,920
Capitalism is a Mode of Production.

669
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,840
What are Productive Forces:
how humans act on nature.

670
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,940
What are Relations of Production:
how humans act on each other.

671
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,040
What is Class:
social division of labor

672
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,880
(as opposed to the natural work division),

673
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,240
position occupied
in the productive process.

674
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,590
Is class determined
by how much money you make? No.

675
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,560
If you earn wages,
you are a worker, OK?

676
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,470
If you earn wages,
you are a proletariat.

677
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,410
"Oh, my salary is 100k/month",
you are a proletariat.

678
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,870
Class is determined
by the social division of labor.

679
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,960
Class is determined
by where you are in the productive process.

680
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,530
What makes it so confusing is

681
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:07,510
that, nowadays, we use such terminology
as "upper class", "middle class",  "lower class".

682
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,140
What determines class for Marxism is

683
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:12,470
the position you occupy
in the productive process,

684
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,620
Right? So that's right.

685
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,860
Private Property:
free disposal of another's labor power.

686
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,310
Remembering that we are talking about
the private property of means of production.

687
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,960
It's not your house,
your old truck, or your flip-flops.

688
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,920
Means of production:
what is necessary for the execution of work.

689
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,090
Factories, raw material, energy.

690
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,190
Capital:
value that creates value,

691
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,400
resource that creates resource,
wealth that creates wealth.

692
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,610
Commodity: something produced
to be consumed by others,

693
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,790
and to be sold in the market, okay?

694
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,730
OK? Let's keep going!

695
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,190
Let’s move on to a subject
that is a bit more complicated,

696
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,030
but fundamental to our understanding
of Marx's critique of Political Economy.

697
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,420
Remember that the commodity
is the center of our social relations?

698
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,610
This commodity has
something called Value.

699
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,550
So, the question
that comes up is:

700
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,360
what is Value?

701
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,120
How is Value determined?

702
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,560
OK, so I'll begin with a quote

703
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,080
hat made me understand Value
once and for all.

704
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,670
But I'll start with the quote
and then we are gonna describe Value,

705
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,360
not the contrary.

706
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,470
"...if I say a quarter of wheat

707
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,000
(quarter is a unit of measure)

708
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:09,180
exchanges with iron
in a certain proportion,

709
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:14,090
or the Value of a quarter of wheat is
expressed in  a  certain  amount  of  iron,

710
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,820
I say that the Value of wheat
and its equivalent in iron

711
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:20,840
are equal
to some third thing,

712
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,740
which is neither
wheat nor iron,

713
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:27,550
because I suppose them to express
the same magnitude in two different shapes.

714
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,900
Either of them,

715
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,670
the wheat or the iron,

716
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,900
must, therefore,
independently of the other, be reducible

717
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,230
to this third thing

718
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,950
which is their common measure."

719
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,660
I've never forgotten this quote.

720
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,300
If a certain amount of wheat
is equal to a certain amount of iron,

721
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:46,250
it does not mean that one is the same as the other,
but that they are equal to a third thing.

722
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,530
And this third thing is Value.

723
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,640
OK, so,
Value.

724
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,390
Value is maybe one of the most complicated
concepts of Political Economy,

725
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,020
even Marx recognized that.

726
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,510
Marx says
in the Introduction to Capital

727
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:59,810
that the first chapter was the most complicated,
and it is the one in which he describes Value

728
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,530
We have
commodities in society,

729
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,800
we buy our things.

730
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,110
These commodities have Value.

731
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,440
Do you remember
when I told you to look around?

732
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,300
and think about
who made the things you have?

733
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,110
All the objects you possess,

734
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,450
all of them,
without exception,

735
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,260
have one substance in common.

736
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,160
Do you know what this substance common
to all the things you have is? Labor

737
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,060
Labor, folks, is
a social substance.

738
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:23,760
Every commodity has in it
some amount of crystallized labor.

739
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,140
Is Value the same thing as price?
No, no.

740
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,670
Is price Value, chat?
No.

741
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,150
Every time you think you're not
understanding what Value is,

742
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,640
be sure you're not
confusing it with price, OK?

743
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,090
So,

744
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,160
what determines the Value of
a commodity?

745
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,890
The labor is socially necessary
for the production of this commodity.

746
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:44,870
Folks, what has more Value,
a glass or a car? A car.

747
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,510
Why?

748
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:50,370
Why? Because the amount of labor
needed to make a car is way bigger.

749
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,590
Making a car requires way more labor
than making a glass.

750
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,480
Therefore, a car has
much more Value than glass.

751
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,980
Does this mean that if I had a glass factory,

752
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,060
and it took me the same amount of time
needed to make a car, to make this glass,

753
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:04,190
the glass would get more expensive?
No, OK?

754
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,590
No.
For the love of God, no.

755
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:12,050
Value is determined by the amount of
socially necessary labor.

756
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,880
The social criteria are fundamental.

757
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,820
What determines Value is the amount of labor

758
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,090
in a certain social state

759
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,610
and under
specific productive conditions

760
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,440
of an entire society.

761
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:27,800
It's how much labor is required
to produce a glass in the entire society,

762
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,370
and not how much you, an individual,
needs to produce a glass, OK?

763
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,120
So, if Value is not price,
what is price, then?

764
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,040
Price is
the expression of value as money

765
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,420
an expression in money.

766
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,810
Price usually
gravitates around value.

767
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,710
This price
gravitates around Value,

768
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,770
Adam Smith,

769
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,170
Adam Smith,
not Marx,

770
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,080
called it central price.

771
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,820
Once a commodity is produced by labor

772
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,970
and it goes out
to be sold on the market.

773
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,300
It (the commodity) will get
closer to its value.

774
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,880
Value is not price,
value is a property of the commodity,

775
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:05,110
and value is determined by
the amount of socially necessary labor.

776
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:08,910
Remember we said that the commodity is
the center of all social relations?

777
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,300
In Capitalism,
our labor power is also a commodity.

778
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,050
We sell our labor power
at market price.

779
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,050
If our labor power is
a commodity,

780
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:19,370
and value is a property
of a commodity,

781
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,970
What is the value of
our labor power?

782
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:24,980
The value of our labor power is also
determined by the socially necessary labor,

783
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,120
but in another way,

784
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,820
the value of
your labor power is

785
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,940
determined by
all that reproduces you.

786
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,710
It's the value of
everything you need to exist.

787
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:38,040
Food, clothing,
roof, heating, etc.

788
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,850
All that
you consume to exist

789
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:42,390
has in it the socially necessary labor
needed to produce it.

790
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,930
The Value of your labor power

791
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,200
is the sum of the values of
all the things you need to exist.

792
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,660
And, in Capitalism,

793
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:51,840
especially, with an extremely
unqualified workforce,

794
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,570
the labor power's value gets close to
the bare minimum you need to maintain yourself

795
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,140
So, when you sell your labor power
on the labor market,

796
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,890
that's why we call it
the labor market,

797
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,510
you are selling it
by its value,

798
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,580
and the value of
your labor power is determined by

799
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,520
what you need
to keep existing.

800
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,540
And this you can derive
from reality, folks.

801
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:15,940
Your salary is being paid to you so that
you can buy what you need to continue existing.

802
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,280
Why is all of that so important?

803
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,300
Because understanding
what value is makes us comprehend

804
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,300
the greatest discovery of
Marxist Political Economy,

805
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,370
which is Surplus Value.

806
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,750
Without understanding value,
we would not understand the surplus value.

807
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,930
Without understanding surplus,
we would not understand capitalism.

808
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,030
"Surplus" can also be "surplus value".

809
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,730
Got it? To understand surplus value,
we need to understand value.

810
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,230
So:

811
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,130
according to Engels,
the discovery of the surplus value is

812
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,720
a discovery of the same magnitude
as Darwin's Theory of Evolution

813
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,130
Why?

814
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:48,430
Because it can expose, strip naked,
the internal mechanisms of exploitation.

815
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,720
When we talk about
exploitation in Capitalism, folks,

816
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,030
we are not judging it.

817
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:56,200
We are describing
the mechanism of Capitalism.

818
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,565
Talking about exploitation in Capitalism
isn't a judgment on moral grounds,

819
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,220
it's merely descriptive.

820
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,540
And this is only understood when
you understand what value and surplus value are.

821
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,430
So, let's go over it again:

822
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,330
what determines
the value of a commodity

823
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,430
is the socially necessary labor contained
in this commodity.

824
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,640
Who does this labor?

825
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:11,920
It's the worker,
not the bourgeois.

826
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,600
The bourgeois doesn't work,
who works is the worker.

827
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:18,500
Very well, after working and creating this value,
in exchange, the worker earns a wage.

828
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:23,300
But the wage of the worker is equal
to the value of his labor power,

829
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,400
and not the value
they created while laboring!

830
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,030
That means that while the worker is working,
and laboring, they create value, create value,

831
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,230
but they earn the equivalent of the value of
the labor power in the form of a wage.

832
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,330
That is, what they create has
no connection with what they earn.

833
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:39,430
What they earn has a connection
with what they need to live.

834
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,630
Imagine the following:

835
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,630
If you have an 8-hour workday

836
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,300
and in four hours you produce
the value equivalent to your salary,

837
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,780
the other four hours
you worked for free.

838
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:53,460
This free labor
we call surplus labor.

839
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:56,090
The value created
in this surplus period is

840
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:01,220
appropriated by the bourgeois
in the form of surplus value.

841
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,430
Surplus value is the mechanism
by which the bourgeois profit.

842
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:10,460
And we have three types of surplus value:
absolute, relative, and extraordinary.

843
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,330
Absolute surplus value expands
as the labor hours expand.

844
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,630
Remember what I said?

845
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:19,370
You need 4 daily hours to generate the value of
your salary, and your workday has 8 hours.

846
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,250
Out of a sudden, your workday goes up to 10 hours,
without a wage increase.

847
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,500
You've created
more surplus value.

848
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,230
Absolute surplus value: the workday increases,
so the capitalist's profit increases.

849
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,400
Now, relative surplus value is:
imagine that you work 8 hours a day,

850
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,160
but the factory got optimized.

851
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,930
Instead of producing x chairs,
you produce, in the same amount of time, 2x chairs.

852
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,120
But you earn the same salary.

853
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,600
You relatively increase the extraction of value;

854
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,760
the labor time needed is the same,
but you can produce way more.

855
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,030
And the extraordinary surplus value has to do
with the production of the same objects,

856
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,770
of the same commodities,
but in other companies.

857
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,390
For example:

858
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:52,280
if there are many companies
producing chairs,

859
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,850
and one of them discovers
a much faster way to produce,

860
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,900
when this commodity
goes to the market,

861
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,440
it, being sold at a similar price as the others,
will yield more profit.

862
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,870
So, extraordinary surplus value
is relative to the industry as a whole,

863
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,910
when some company discovers
a way to lower their costs.

864
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:11,540
This surplus value tends
to find an equilibrium in two ways:

865
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,900
either when some other companies
also gets optimized,

866
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,100
or when all the others go bankrupt,
creating a monopoly.

867
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:20,570
The point is: the final goal of every bourgeois is
the increase in surplus value.

868
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,210
The increase.
The increase.

869
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,670
This is not moral judgment.

870
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,340
Marx at no moment makes
some moral judgment.

871
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,340
He doesn't say "it's bad", "good",
"ugly", "stupid", or "blockhead".

872
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:37,440
Saying that the goal of the bourgeois is
the increase of surplus value is descriptive,

873
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,710
because this is observable,
we can verify it in reality.

874
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,060
And what is important here?

875
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,420
As profit is extracted
utilizing the surplus value,

876
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:49,640
the bourgeois incorporates
this profit back into their capital.

877
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,060
When the surplus value is extracted,

878
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:55,140
the bourgeois reinvests it in production
to increase the extraction of surplus value.

879
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,730
They refine more
this extraction each time more

880
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,660
in an endless
and unceasing cycle.

881
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:04,840
Capitalism has shown
a cyclical crises since its beginnings.

882
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:09,660
Already in the 1870's,
Engels talked about seven crises of capitalism.

883
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,920
Seven!
In the 19th century.

884
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,210
This is when capitalism was
way smaller than it is today;

885
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,990
when it was restricted to
just a few of countries.

886
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,180
So, let's wrap it up?

887
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,220
Marx's critique of Political Economy
focuses on analyzing capitalism.

888
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,540
Capitalism is a mode of production based
on the employment of big industries.

889
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:27,140
in the division of labor,
in class society, in private property,

890
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,910
in the commodity as center of social relations
and constant expansion of capital.

891
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,450
Let's recap some concepts.

892
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,290
We have seen the value
and surplus value.

893
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,170
Value:
it is a "property of the commodity.”

894
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:39,170
And this property
is "determined by the socially necessary labor.”

895
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:44,420
Surplus value is the "value created by the worker
which is appropriated by the bourgeois",

896
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,840
and that doesn't return to the worker.

897
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,800
This surplus value can be:

898
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,560
"absolute",
when the working hours increase;

899
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,170
"relative",
when productivity increases;

900
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,920
"extraordinary" when the productivity
in comparison to other factories increases.

901
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:55,570
OK?

902
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,870
And why is it all that important

903
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,290
Weren't we going to
talk about communism?

904
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,700
Why are we talking
so much about capitalism?

905
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:02,450
Understanding the capitalist
mode of production is necessary

906
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,940
so we can walk towards
some other mode of production,

907
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,330
and transform our productive forces
and our relations of production.

908
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,910
Remember we said that Marxism and Communism
have an aversion towards utopianism?

909
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,270
Towards utopia, idealism?

910
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:20,440
Every Marxist analysis,
starts from material reality.

911
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,170
This is Marx's object of study:

912
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:29,200
observing capitalism's reality,
the reality in which he was living.

913
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,720
OK?

914
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,000
And then,
we go to the last pillar of Marxism,

915
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,810
which we call
scientific socialism.

916
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,450
So, by now we've got a basic,
and I mean really basic, analysis

917
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,160
of the way capitalism works,
then what?

918
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,810
We've seen that capitalism exploits us
and throws us into poverty.

919
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:44,510
So, what to do?

920
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:44,840
Very well,

921
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:48,240
capitalism has developed
our productive forces in a way never seen before.

922
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:52,910
It brought an unprecedented level
of productivity, unknown to humanity by then.

923
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,710
However, at the same time, it threw
a huge part of humanity into misery,

924
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,160
excluded from society

925
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,790
A huge chunk of people was proletarianized,
lost everything they had,

926
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,300
and turned to sell their work force
in exchange for the bare minimum to survive

927
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,630
while bearing
strenuous work hours.

928
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,040
So,

929
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,220
how did we sharply increase
productivity and poverty at the same time?

930
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,350
How did we increase

931
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:16,000
machinery and automation levels
and work load simultaneously?

932
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,020
Why is it that there's more and more automation
and work load never decreases?

933
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,770
Those are the contradictions
that will be our aim in this next analysis.

934
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,290
Okay, next:

935
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,620
"Analyzing Capitalism",

936
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:28,610
We've concluded
that capitalism is based on exploitation, right?

937
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:28,950
Very well,

938
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,580
The first thing
we can know for a fact is:

939
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:34,750
there's no exploiters without the exploited,
this has always been the case, right?

940
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,990
Were there always
exploiters and the exploited?

941
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,120
Let's dig into that.

942
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,090
We know also

943
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,460
that the mechanism of exploitation comes
through private property.

944
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:45,740
Marx, through the method
(dialectical and historical materialism),

945
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,110
come to the reasoning that
there has not always been private property.

946
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,760
And not just that,

947
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,960
he also found that there's been different kinds
of private property throughout history.

948
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,750
The same goes to social classes,
those weren't always in the scene,

949
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,400
throughout history,
social classes are quite a lot different.

950
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,480
It's that the existence of social classes
and private property

951
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:09,730
Is linked to a certain phase of
the development of production.

952
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,970
What's so relevant about that?

953
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:15,470
This conclusion by Marx
makes us be able to see that

954
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,740
These social organizations,
these human organizations,

955
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,330
are not indispensable.

956
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:24,660
Private property isn't indispensable
for human society.

957
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,310
Social classes aren't imperative
for human society.

958
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,880
So, the notion that there will always be
employers and employees is false.

959
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,990
Not only this,
through the material analysis of capitalism,

960
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,870
Marx got to the conclusion

961
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:42,390
that we already have resources
to march towards another society,

962
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,470
With different social relations.

963
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,030
So, let's go,

964
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,870
a little quote from Marx here
for us to discuss,

965
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,210
from the Communist Manifesto:

966
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:52,940
"an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs,
would have seemed an absurdity

967
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,520
— the epidemic of over-production.

968
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,880
The conditions of bourgeois society are too
narrow to comprise the wealth created by them"

969
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,130
What does Marx mean here?

970
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,290
By the first time in history,

971
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:06,850
human society was dealing
with the inverse of its usual problem.

972
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:09,850
Until then, society had only dealt
with the issue of lacking production.

973
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:12,190
Society had a scarcity issue.

974
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:16,260
The capitalist mode of production
brought a new problem:

975
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,430
excess of production.

976
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,080
The catch is:

977
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,650
there's only excess
of production in capitalism,

978
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:27,140
for the capitalist means of production
are illogic, irrational.

979
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,750
Capitalism does not produce
to satisfy our needs,

980
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,930
it does to sate
the needs of the capital.

981
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:36,870
If production doesn't become capital
it is disposed of.

982
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,720
Meaning,

983
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,770
the capitalist means of production
jeopardize our production capability.

984
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,830
We're hindered from producing
more and better due to capitalism.

985
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:52,490
So according to Marx,
the capitalist ways are obsolete.

986
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:53,960
OBSOLETE.

987
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,930
They need to be transformed.

988
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:59,450
Is such transformation possible?
Not only possible.

989
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:01,850
according to Marx,
it's very likely.

990
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:02,220
Why?

991
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,780
Throughout capitalism's development,

992
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:08,860
it creates its own contradictions
which will bring its downfall,

993
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,720
unavoidably

994
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,070
By expanding,
capitalism generate proletarians,

995
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,580
proletarian by proletarian,
more, more and more

996
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:20,370
This class that it creates is
the one that antagonizes it.

997
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:24,910
Marxism's greatest asset was to perceive
that there are not only classes,

998
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:29,420
and that those classes are
unavoidably antagonistic to each other.

999
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:34,280
They'll never reach harmony,
for they have contradictory interests.

1000
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,730
To this antagonism between
the two main classes of capitalist society,

1001
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:43,340
we call class struggle.
Class struggle.

1002
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,680
For Marxism,

1003
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,680
every doctrine,

1004
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,900
each and every set of principles

1005
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,990
that attempts to balance classes,
and harmonize classes

1006
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:57,600
are utopian.
It's fallacious.

1007
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,660
It's a facade.

1008
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:03,450
If there is an exploited class,
there will be an exploiter class above it

1009
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,150
Every time.

1010
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,990
The Utopians,
which we talked about before,

1011
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,900
had no perspective
of any class.

1012
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,810
They sought a society
that balanced all of humanity.

1013
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:16,340
having the perspective of the classes is
knowing that they are antagonistic.

1014
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:20,530
it is fundamental
to what we call Scientific Socialism;

1015
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,740
which is how Engels name it.

1016
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:25,900
This expression appeared
to contrast with Utopian Socialism.

1017
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,240
So, why does this matter?

1018
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,350
According to Marx,

1019
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:31,110
the class struggle
between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat

1020
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,070
will lead
to a rupture with capitalism.

1021
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:37,120
What's relevant about Marx is
that not only does he identify the classes,

1022
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:41,300
But he also credits the revolutionary protagonist
to the exploited class.

1023
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,910
The proletariat becomes
the revolution's Subject.

1024
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:47,650
The proletariat belongs
to the class that will conduct revolution,

1025
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:48,810
unlike the Utopians.

1026
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:49,850
Utopians believed

1027
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:53,730
that the working-class were
unable to lead any change.

1028
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,840
That any change
would come top-down.

1029
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,590
Marx said otherwise:
it will come bottom-up.

1030
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:01,120
And how will this rupture
be conducted?

1031
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,870
The proletarian class,
becoming aware of itself,

1032
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:07,550
will organize
And seize the power of State

1033
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:11,880
and institute something called
the dictatorship of the proletariat.

1034
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,050
What does dictatorship
of the proletariat mean?

1035
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:17,680
To Marx, we live in a dictatorship
of the bourgeoisie.

1036
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,110
The State does not arise as
an apparatus that balances society.

1037
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:24,270
You'll see idealists,
to this day,

1038
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:28,630
saying that the State arises
to reduce society's conflicts.

1039
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:29,240
No.

1040
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:34,480
For Marx, the State is
an apparatus of specific class violence.

1041
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:40,750
The State arises so the ruling class maintain
the ruled one in its due place,

1042
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,710
through violence.

1043
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,420
In the capitalist society,

1044
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:48,360
who has the State apparatus
is the bourgeoisie.

1045
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,760
The State is puppeteered
by the bourgeoisie

1046
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,800
to maintain the bourgeoisie on power.
Alright?

1047
00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:00,010
So, for Marx, we live in something called
the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

1048
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,080
If there is capitalism,
there's dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

1049
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,770
Well, if the State is necessarily

1050
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:06,760
an apparatus of
specific class violence,

1051
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,970
when the working-class
takes the State,

1052
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:11,300
won't it still be that?
Yes, exactly.

1053
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,670
But this pyramid
will be turned.

1054
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,630
The State is an apparatus of
specific class violence;

1055
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:17,960
with the working-class taking
the State apparatus,

1056
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,150
it will use the State apparatus for,
through violence,

1057
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:24,090
eradicate the bourgeoisie as class.

1058
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,960
The State is an apparatus
of specific class violence,

1059
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,960
and it will still keep being as such.

1060
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,960
So, the State
in the hands of the working class

1061
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,950
will oppress the bourgeoisie
until it vanishes,

1062
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:37,830
and while
the other classes vanishes,

1063
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:40,370
the State becomes obsolete.

1064
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:42,260
Once there are no more classes
to oppress,

1065
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,440
the State no longer needs to exist,

1066
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,990
and it languishes.
It disappears.

1067
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:50,110
It becomes useless.

1068
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:54,160
That's Marx's vision of the transition
from socialism to communism.

1069
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,050
That's the way the State dies out
in the Marxist point of view.

1070
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,440
Alright?
So, let's recapitulate.

1071
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,110
"The scientific socialism: demonstrates
that the existence of classes

1072
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:05,990
it's connected only to certain phases
of production development.”

1073
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,840
Once, they did not exist.
They can cease to exist.

1074
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,160
With the private property,
it's the same thing.

1075
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:13,960
"The class struggle conduces,
necessarily, to proletariat's dictatorship",

1076
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,930
and "this dictatorship is nothing more

1077
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:20,820
than the transition to abolition of
all classes, and to a classless society."

1078
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:22,660
That's Marx's great discovery.

1079
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:26,120
And here, we have to make
a small observation:

1080
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,170
I've been using the terms
socialism and communism,

1081
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,140
but we need to distinguish
one from the other.

1082
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,110
So, firstly:
socialism and communism

1083
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:35,080
only have the meaning they have today
after the Russian Revolution.

1084
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:35,370
So,

1085
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:39,240
Socialism is
the step of the transition to communism.

1086
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:42,530
During socialism,
the working class will be at power

1087
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,280
and it will oppress the bourgeoisie
until the classes vanish.

1088
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,780
During communism,
the classes no longer exist.

1089
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:49,280
Marx doesn't use these terms.

1090
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,900
Marx uses
"the first stage of communist society"

1091
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,980
and "superior stage
of communist society".

1092
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:58,340
The reason behind it, after
the Russian Revolution, the terms are switched,

1093
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,080
it's historical,
and it has the reason to be so.

1094
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,080
It made sense
at the time it came about.

1095
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:05,020
But do know that, from now on,
I will use "socialism" as transition

1096
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,280
and "communism" as destination.

1097
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:11,860
Another thing: Marx doesn't determine
the specific characteristics of socialism.

1098
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,760
Marx was a materialist.

1099
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,180
For him, any prediction
or recipe was idealism.

1100
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:23,940
All societies should start
from a material analysis. A real one, OK? Not ideal.

1101
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,600
Marx can't make the same mistake
he criticized in the Utopians.

1102
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,340
So, Marx only presents
general ideas:

1103
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,600
socialism is the working-class at power,
dictatorship of the proletariat

1104
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,450
and transition in direction of
a society without classes.

1105
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,040
That's why every time someone asks

1106
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,310
"how many brands of washing powder
will exist in socialism?",

1107
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:40,020
anything we could answer
is going to be speculation.

1108
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,930
There's no way to know.
We'll know the details

1109
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,360
from experience.

1110
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,820
And the soviets detail
much more about what is socialism. Why?

1111
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,400
Because they had a socialist experience!

1112
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:53,460
Marx didn't.
Therefore, he didn't dare to predict the future

1113
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,460
beyond what he knew was possible.

1114
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:58,880
He knew it was possible
that the working-class take the State apparatus;

1115
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,600
That it was possible for the workers to use
the State apparatus to oppress the bourgeoisie;

1116
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,460
He knew it was possible.

1117
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,900
And it was possible.
And it was done!

1118
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,180
All of this came from
the material analysis.

1119
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,280
Another thing:

1120
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,780
that means that, after the revolution,
on day one of socialism,

1121
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,640
all the contradictions will go away?

1122
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,400
Contradiction's gone.

1123
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,020
The capitalism died,
any opposer died, and everything died. No.

1124
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,100
Marx's quote:

1125
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:25,240
"What we have to deal with here i
s a communist society,

1126
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,300
not as it has developed
on its own foundations,

1127
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:32,320
but, on the contrary,
just as it emerges from capitalist society;

1128
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,520
[a communist society],
which is thus

1129
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:38,020
in every respect,
economically, morally, and intellectually,

1130
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:42,920
still stamped with the birthmarks of
the old society from whose womb it emerges".

1131
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,940
So, just remembering:

1132
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:45,010
in this quote,

1133
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:49,270
Marx is using the word communism
as we use the word socialism today, alright?

1134
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:51,760
Here, Marx is talking about
the first stage of communism.

1135
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,960
That's why I had
to clarify the vocabulary here.

1136
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,870
What's the point here?

1137
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,090
A society that comes
from the womb of another,

1138
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,120
and with that it carries
its birthmarks.

1139
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:04,100
If we have a capitalist, sexist society
and we go through a revolution,

1140
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,300
the new society
will still be sexist.

1141
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,200
This contradiction
will not disappear.

1142
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:15,360
The question is, the new society gives us
the possibility to overcome sexism,

1143
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,800
while capitalism doesn't.

1144
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,700
Capitalism doesn't give us the opportunity
of overcoming many contradictions.

1145
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,560
So,

1146
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,360
Oh, but what about Cuba?
wasn't Cuba misogynist? wasn't Cuba homophobic?"

1147
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,980
Cuba came from
a misogynist and homophobic society.

1148
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,200
It would be strange if it wasn't so anymore
on day one of the revolution.

1149
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,620
So, we can't
generalize socialism as well,

1150
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:37,170
because each socialist experience will emerge
from a different capitalist experience;

1151
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,580
with their own particularities and with
their particular contradictions. Alright?

1152
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,920
That was all about Marxism.
We have:

1153
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,800
dialectical and historical materialism,
political economy, and scientific socialism.

1154
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:51,060
Now, we go to the last basic part
which is necessary and essential.

1155
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,680
We're going to talk
about Lenin now.

1156
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,900
This Lenin, here. So, let's go.
Why are we talking about Lenin?

1157
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,210
By now, you should know

1158
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,310
that the first successful revolution

1159
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:01,010
of a socialist nature was
the Russian Revolution of 1917.

1160
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,050
On the Russian Revolution,
and the whole Soviet experience,

1161
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:06,050
I would need to do
a separate video.

1162
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,320
Today we are going to talk about
the greatest leader of this revolution,

1163
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:10,970
which is Vladimir Ilyich Ulianov,
or Lenin.

1164
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:15,600
Because Lenin is the greatest Marxist
after Marx and Engels.

1165
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,280
For those who don't know,
Lenin is a great theoretician.

1166
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,980
And not only big,
but he is also unavoidable.

1167
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:23,600
It was because
of Lenin's theoretical work

1168
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,820
that the Russian Revolution was possible.

1169
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,420
And why is Lenin so important?

1170
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:31,760
Because Lenin gives
an operational dimension to Marxism,

1171
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,580
he develops a method
for the practical application of Marxism.

1172
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:40,640
And there are several elements
of what we call Leninism today,

1173
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,820
but today I'm just going to talk about one,
which is perhaps the main one,

1174
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,920
which is the party.

1175
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,410
And come on,

1176
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,300
let's talk about the party.

1177
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,960
Since the time of Marx and Engels,

1178
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,900
it was already known
that it was necessary to organize the class.

1179
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,420
What did Lenin do?
He observed reality,

1180
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,240
just like Marx and Engels did,

1181
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,480
he saw how the class
was organized,

1182
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,300
and proposed
a new form of organization.

1183
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:06,340
This new form of organization
is called the Leninist party.

1184
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,260
And then arises the question:

1185
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,720
when we think of a party,
we think of abbreviations

1186
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,840
that run for the parlament.

1187
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,660
run for Congress, run for the Executive.

1188
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,220
I'll tell you something
in advance:

1189
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,660
that's not
what a Leninist party is about.

1190
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:21,610
In fact, it has no intention
of winning the election, okay?

1191
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:24,840
The Leninist party does
not come about to win elections.

1192
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,390
What is the Leninist Party?

1193
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:30,760
The Leninist party is
the organized detachment of the working-class.

1194
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,110
Lenin used to say,
his quote:

1195
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:38,300
“In its struggle for power the proletariat has
no other weapon but organization.”

1196
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,860
The Leninist party,
unlike parties running for elections,

1197
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,380
organizes itself
on a revolutionary basis.

1198
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:48,940
The party's idea is to prepare
and mobilize the class to take power;

1199
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:52,400
not in a peaceful way,
but in a combative way.

1200
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,040
The seizure of power needs
to be done in a combative way,

1201
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,360
because the ruling class
will not voluntarily relinquish power.

1202
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:03,380
In Russia, that party
was the Bolshevik party.

1203
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,380
What are the elements of this party?

1204
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:11,480
Firstly, the party must be
the vanguard detachment of the class.

1205
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,480
What does vanguard mean?

1206
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,100
Vanguard is a military term.

1207
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,960
Vanguard means who is in front,
it is the opposite of rearguard.

1208
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,660
The vanguard is
the best elements of the working-class:

1209
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,180
the most experienced,

1210
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:27,580
most dedicated, most revolutionary,
most enlightened workers.

1211
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:31,040
That party must arm itself
with a revolutionary theory;

1212
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,520
Another quote from Lenin,
also famous:

1213
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,680
“Without revolutionary theory
there can be no revolutionary movement.”

1214
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,510
But this party

1215
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:39,990
cannot serve only to absorb
what the working class thinks.

1216
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:44,000
The party appears, and then the idea
is not to see what the working class is thinking

1217
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,420
and represent the class
from what it is spontaneously thinking.

1218
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:50,960
The party has to arm the class
with revolutionary theory;

1219
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,720
because, for Lenin, the working class
organizes spontaneously.

1220
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,720
But this working-class organization
is limited.

1221
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,840
The class,
when organized spontaneously,

1222
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,860
usually fights for the improvement
of their immediate condition

1223
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:05,980
— salary improvement,
reduced working hours, labor rights —

1224
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:09,020
but it does not fight towards
overthrowing the system.

1225
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:12,440
Why it is so?
Because it cannot see
the mechanism of this system.

1226
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:15,960
Since capitalism is a system,
it is a synthesis, it is an abstraction,

1227
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,540
you cannot approach the worker,
point and say “capitalism is there”.

1228
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,640
But they can see
that they can't pay the bills,

1229
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,320
they can see
that they are working too hard,

1230
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,320
and they can see that
when they get sick they get screwed.

1231
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,380
They can see all of this.

1232
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,000
And then the class
will organize itself.

1233
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,720
But the party cannot
just absorb this demand.

1234
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,760
It has to arm the class
with something else.

1235
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,700
And that something else
is the overthrow of the system!

1236
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:37,300
That's why this party needs
to be leading the class.

1237
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:40,130
And mind you,
it's not above!

1238
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,460
It's not above.

1239
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,380
It's ahead! It's ahead.

1240
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,640
The party has to be
the political leader of the class. Why?

1241
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:52,220
Because it can arm the class
with revolutionary tactical theory.

1242
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:56,780
But this party can never
disconnect from the masses.

1243
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:59,020
It has to have the advanced
detachments of the class,

1244
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,940
but not isolate himself from the class.

1245
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,080
It has to be connected
to the masses

1246
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,360
and has to convince
the masses.

1247
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:10,580
The party needs to work closely
with the entire working class

1248
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:13,820
to gain moral credit
and political credit

1249
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:17,220
through example,
through persuasion.

1250
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,500
And for that, it needs to be organized.
What does that mean?

1251
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:25,420
Within a Leninist party,
discipline must be ironclad

1252
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:26,480
but willing.

1253
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,880
When you join the party,

1254
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:32,360
you willingly submit
to iron discipline.

1255
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:36,220
And this is to awaken
the revolutionary spirit in the classes,

1256
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:38,220
through example.

1257
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:41,820
Does this mean that the party
should be the only organization?

1258
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,520
It does not.
Should not. Cannot even.

1259
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,440
Society must have
a series of class organizations:

1260
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,540
Unions, cooperatives,
organizations, associations, and youths.

1261
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,700
In the case of Russia,
there was a very important one: the soviets.

1262
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:59,120
The soviets, folks, were the factory councils
that were formed spontaneously.

1263
00:55:59,120 --> 00:55:59,820
The point is:

1264
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:03,440
the party cannot work in all areas
of the working class alone.

1265
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,260
The party must work closely
with these organizations

1266
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:11,120
to connect these organizations
in favor of the emancipatory struggle.

1267
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:14,800
He must centralize
the tactics of these organizations.

1268
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,020
How? Forcibly? No,

1269
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,780
through persuasion.

1270
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:21,500
Party members will join these organizations,

1271
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,420
talk to the workers,
convince the workers,

1272
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,720
demonstrate the need
to fight by example,

1273
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,100
approach these organizations

1274
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:33,560
and win the political support
of the masses.

1275
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,580
The Bolshevik party did
exactly that.

1276
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:40,720
The Bolshevik party did
not make a revolution

1277
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,320
until it gained
a majority in the soviets.

1278
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,460
The soviets were
the main organs of the working class;

1279
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,900
the party worked
closely with the soviets

1280
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:53,200
trying all the time to convince
the soviets of the need for a revolution,

1281
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,100
It managed to convince the class,

1282
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,580
won a majority in the soviets,

1283
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,520
and then he led a revolution.

1284
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:00,980
Lenin not only theorized,
but he also did!

1285
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:02,780
He applied it!

1286
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,520
Do you get how important this dude is?

1287
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,920
So, the party has
two functions (in short, okay?)

1288
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,480
Leading the class
into the revolution

1289
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,980
and, after the revolution,
maintaining the revolution;

1290
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:14,460
that is, it has a pre-revolution
and a post-revolution function.

1291
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,040
Regardless of what you think
of everything I said;

1292
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,040
“Oh Ian, I don't like it.
Not at all.

1293
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,240
I found the party... bad.
I found it authoritative. Did not like it";

1294
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,700
Regardless of
what you think,

1295
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:28,330
Lenin's method is extremely efficient.

1296
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:33,860
Ever heard of China? Cuba?
Korea? Vietnam? Albania? Burkina Faso?

1297
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,780
Everyone, each one of them
used the Leninist method.

1298
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,460
Regardless of
what you think,

1299
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:42,680
Leninist party is an extremely
efficient method

1300
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,820
for the seizure of power by the class.
Extremely efficient.

1301
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:46,820
So, let's go.
Shall we review?

1302
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:50,560
“Party." The Leninist party is:
the “organized detachment of the class”.

1303
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,260
This detachment
must be a “vanguard”;

1304
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,260
i.e. to be at the head of the class,
not above.

1305
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:57,420
That party must be
“armed with theory”,

1306
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:58,720
revolutionary theory.

1307
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,560
This party has willing
and ironclad discipline.

1308
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,900
That party “must mobilize
the class for the Revolution”,

1309
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,980
and after the revolution
“it must maintain the revolution”.

1310
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,060
That's the party.

1311
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:11,800
There are many, many, other
Leninist elements about the organization

1312
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:12,940
and other things.

1313
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:13,600
The point is:

1314
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:18,340
Lenin was a machine.
The guy wrote compulsively.

1315
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,400
When he had a stroke,

1316
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,190
the doctors had to ask for God's sake
for him to stop writing, for him not to die.

1317
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,480
He was limited to writing ten minutes a day
so he wouldn't have another stroke.

1318
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,280
Lenin is a Marxist machine.

1319
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:29,940
In order to understand the organization,

1320
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,840
you have to read Lenin.
You really have to read it.

1321
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,100
Let's head into the end, folks!

1322
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,780
Remember I said I was going to give you
a reading guide for you to delve into?

1323
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,040
So, let's get into
our reading guide,

1324
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,060
and what I'm going to
talk about is this:

1325
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,860
I'm going to suggest an order,

1326
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,320
which is the one
that I'm going to present here.

1327
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,420
All the books,
except the one on the screen,

1328
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,120
will be available for free
in the video description.

1329
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:46,540
So, let's go.

1330
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,900
If you, after watching the video,
are still feeling insecure,

1331
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,080
read this book by Grespan,
“Marx: an introduction”.

1332
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,860
It's a super short book

1333
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:55,780
that serves to introduce everyone
to the Marxist vocabulary,

1334
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:59,240
and I recommend it even
to anyone who wants to learn to teach Marxism,

1335
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,100
because it is a very didactic book.

1336
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,300
There, the first text
I suggest after this video

1337
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,540
is a very short text
by Lenin

1338
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:09,400
called “The Three Sources
and Three Component Parts of Marxism”.

1339
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,860
It's a text that Lenin wrote
on the 30th anniversary of Marx's death,

1340
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:15,920
and Lenin talks about the Marxist sources

1341
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,220
that have precisely
these three elements that we talked about:

1342
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:19,860
philosophy, politics, and economics.

1343
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,080
I highly recommend reading it,
it is a very small

1344
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,640
and very enlightening text.

1345
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:27,940
Remembering that Lenin did not have access
to all of Marx's texts, which we have access today.

1346
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,440
So, there are texts that are missing,
simply because he did not have access to them.

1347
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:32,320
Next. There are two together here,
look:

1348
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:35,060
“Basic Principles of Communism”
by my boy Engels,

1349
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:38,100
and “Manifesto of the Communist Party”
by homies Marx and Engels.

1350
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,440
A little story for you:

1351
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,380
Marx and Engels, in the 1840s,
joined something called the League of the Just.

1352
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:46,980
What was the League of the Just? It was
an organization of emigrants from Germany,

1353
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,220
which was a mixture
of German idealism and utopian socialism.

1354
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,770
Marx and Engels enter the league

1355
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:53,630
under the condition that they can change
the political line of the league.

1356
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,300
So, they: change the name of the League of the Just
to the League of Communists;

1357
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:01,780
change the motto from “all men are brothers”
to “workers of all countries, unite!”;

1358
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:05,180
and are in charge of writing
the League's program.

1359
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,840
At the first meeting of the League,
Engels goes, but Marx doesn't.

1360
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:09,470
And then Engels is
in charge of writing

1361
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:11,900
and he writes this book,
“Basic Principles of Communism”.

1362
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,640
But he writes in the form of a catechism,
in questions and answers.

1363
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,020
Marx doesn't like
the catechism format

1364
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:20,240
and proposed the manifesto format.

1365
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:23,440
And then they together write
“The Manifesto of the Communist Party”.

1366
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:24,800
The first book by Engels,

1367
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,840
Basic Principles of Communism,
was never published.

1368
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,520
Not in life,
it was published later.

1369
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:31,220
There are topics that Engels doesn't answer,
because it was a draft.

1370
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:34,160
The Communist Manifesto
is a very important book,

1371
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:37,260
because it is
the most well-finished first book on Marxism

1372
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,060
with all its core elements.

1373
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,680
It has three important things:

1374
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,720
a historical analysis
as a starting point;

1375
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,940
the perspective of classes as an axis;

1376
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:48,940
and to place the proletarian class
as revolutionary,

1377
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,480
a revolutionary subject.

1378
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,080
The Communist Party Manifesto

1379
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,600
is the most important
political document in history.

1380
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,760
That document
changed the world.

1381
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:58,760
Well worth reading and rereading
and reading again.

1382
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:01,160
Moreover: in 1877,

1383
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,160
Engels already old,
already elderly,

1384
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,280
writes a book called
“Anti-Dühring”,

1385
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,940
which is a critique of the philosophy
of a guy called Eugen Dühring.

1386
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:09,840
Engels makes
such a concise critique,

1387
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,740
and expounds Marxism
so competently,

1388
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:14,740
that the book is somewhat
of an unexpected success.

1389
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:17,440
And then he extracts
three chapters from Anti-Dühring,

1390
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,680
which is a big book,

1391
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,510
and publishes it
as this book here:

1392
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,800
“From Utopian Socialism
to Scientific Socialism”

1393
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:26,660
in which he talks about
some utopian thinkers

1394
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:29,820
and contrasts with the thought
of historical and dialectical materialism.

1395
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:32,800
This one is very interesting,
equally short,

1396
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:34,060
and well worth reading.

1397
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:36,180
One more:
“Value, Price and Profit”.

1398
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:39,740
Value, Price and Profit
is a lecture given by Marx

1399
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:44,260
in 1865 to the International
Workers' Association.

1400
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:46,680
And in that book,
Marx is just talking about

1401
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:50,980
how the wage is not related
to the price of the commodity.

1402
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:54,380
And here, to explain this,
he explains value and surplus value.

1403
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:56,980
So, I recommend it too.
It is a short text because it is a lecture;

1404
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:00,320
and I recommend it as Marx's first text
on the critique of political economy.

1405
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:03,040
But if you're feeling daring;

1406
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:05,580
The critique of political economy,
Marx's magnanimous

1407
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,820
"Capital".
Capital is three books,

1408
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:10,290
three huge books, like that,
which took him 16 years to write.

1409
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:11,120
It's worth reading.

1410
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:15,120
But if you're not feeling so daring,
I'll recommend another book:

1411
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:18,840
“Handbook of Political Economy”
by the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union.

1412
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,580
It's an equally gigantic book;

1413
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:23,060
but it has,
due to the Soviet experience,

1414
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:26,480
an excerpt that Capital does not have,
which is about the socialist mode of production.

1415
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:29,820
So, if you have these doubts like:
“how is the organization of work under socialism?”

1416
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,820
“How is surplus value in socialism?”,

1417
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:33,700
“how is the factory in socialism?”,

1418
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,500
“How is the mode of production?”, and such;

1419
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:38,000
this book talks about it.
I recommend these two, okay?

1420
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,580
But they are gigantic books,

1421
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:42,560
they are not books to leave by your bedside
and read every night, they are to be consulted.

1422
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:45,000
One more:
“The German Ideology”.

1423
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,720
Lenin did not have access to this text.

1424
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:51,060
This text is a text that
Marx and Engels wrote in 1846,

1425
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,900
criticizing the Young Hegelians,

1426
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,700
and it's the best example
we have of historical materialism.

1427
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:57,860
Despite the book being gigantic,

1428
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:00,310
I recommend only the first chapter,
the most important one,

1429
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:01,660
which is “Feuerbach”.

1430
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:04,700
That book was the one I read in college
to understand historical materialism.

1431
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:08,100
It looks big, but in fact
only the first chapter is the most essential.

1432
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:09,980
One more:
“Critique of the Gotha Program”.

1433
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:11,220
“Oh, Ian,
I don't even know what Gotha is.

1434
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,360
Why would I read this book
when I don't even know what Gotha is?"

1435
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,480
The Gotha Program

1436
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,960
was the program
for the unification of German workers' parties.

1437
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:21,420
Marx, when criticizing
the unification program of these parties,

1438
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:24,300
Expounded much more
about socialism.

1439
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,870
So, he talks about:
a dictatorship of the proletariat,

1440
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:29,980
the first phase of communism,
the higher stage of communism,

1441
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:31,520
talks about the role of the State.

1442
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,200
He talks about the period
of transition from socialism to communism.

1443
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,020
This book is very important;
it's short, too. Very short.

1444
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,300
And then, moving on
to Lenin.

1445
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,260
People say all the time:
“read Lenin, read Lenin!”

1446
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:42,180
Let's read Lenin then,
shall we?

1447
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,820
First book:
“What is to be done?”.

1448
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,820
What is to the done? is a book
that Lenin writes in 1902,

1449
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:50,980
for the Second Congress
of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party.

1450
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:54,620
Lenin was part of a party at that time,
the Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party,

1451
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:57,880
and he writes this book
to present his party ideas,

1452
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,580
that would become the Leninist Party
in Congress.

1453
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:03,120
This book is a perfect example

1454
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:07,060
of how Lenin thought about
revolutionary party organization.

1455
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:08,740
One more:
“The State and the Revolution”.

1456
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:13,340
This book is a book that is even good
to read as Lenin's first book, too.

1457
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:13,840
Why?

1458
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,820
Here, Lenin talks about
the role of the State in a revolution

1459
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:19,300
— Much like what Marx does
in the Critique of the Gotha Program —

1460
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,740
talking about what is
the role of the State in a revolution,

1461
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:23,740
how the working class
should manage the State,

1462
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:25,420
what is it for;
and what is the State,

1463
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,840
he theorizes about the State, too.

1464
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:28,360
This book here,
if you're going to read it,

1465
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:30,780
is Marx and Engels through and through.

1466
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:32,940
Here you can see
how he mastered the subject.

1467
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:36,060
And finally, a part of Leninist theory
that I haven't mentioned

1468
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:37,340
but is
just as important.

1469
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:41,180
Lenin identifies
that capitalism has entered a new phase:

1470
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,580
the imperialist phase.

1471
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:47,600
Capitalism expands in such a way
that it becomes monopoly capitalism,

1472
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:49,620
and the countries
at the center of capitalism

1473
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:53,130
begin to dispute
the division of the territory of planet Earth

1474
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:54,120
for resources.

1475
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,440
Lenin theorizing
the new phase of capitalism

1476
01:04:57,550 --> 01:04:59,580
is what made
the Russian Revolution possible, folks.

1477
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:02,940
So, this book here [Imperialism,
the Highest Stage of Capitalism] is essential,

1478
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:06,000
because imperialism
is still our greatest enemy.

1479
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,660
Understanding the role
of imperialism in global capitalism

1480
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:11,580
is fundamental to
any revolutionary perspective, anyone.

1481
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:15,720
I will leave all these books
for free in the description, free of charge.

1482
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:19,520
All are available on marxists.org,
in Portuguese,

1483
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,600
except for this one.

1484
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,980
This one, as Mr. Jorge Grespan
needs to pay his bills,

1485
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:25,980
this book here
needs to be purchased.

1486
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:27,720
But that's it, folks.
This was today's video,

1487
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,960
"Basic Principles of Communism".

1488
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,560
I hope
you've learned something.

1489
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,920
It's a video I made
to be consulted,

1490
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,360
and I encourage you
to ask questions.

1491
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:39,560
If you want to ask me something
unclear, you can ask me.

1492
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:43,020
I just don't promise to reply quickly
because I've been getting a lot of messages.

1493
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:46,100
But I do my best
because as a teacher I need

1494
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,560
to answer questions like that too.

1495
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,140
